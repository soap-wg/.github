# SOAP - An OpenID Connect-based Social Authentication Protocol Applied to Messaging Applications

SOAP is a social authentication protocol.
When performing social authentication, users verify that their chat partner controls accounts at different identity providers (IdPs) which they know are controlled by their intended chat partner.
Using social authentication, users can verify, for example, that their messaging application chat is not intercepted by a MITM.
By building on top of the popular OpenID Connect protocol, SOAP automates the authentication ceremony and does not require adoption from any OpenID Connect-IdP.
